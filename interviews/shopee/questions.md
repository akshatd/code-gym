# Question 1
Given 2 lines input, count the max number of occurrence of the number

For eg:
```
3
1 0 1
```
Should output `2`
```
5
1 0 1 0 0
```
Should output `3`

# Question 2

Given a string as input, output the number of ways to decode
```
A -> 1
B -> 2
.
.
.
Z-> 26
```
If input is `121` the output should be `3`
```
1, 2, 1
12, 1
1, 21
```
If input is `1111` the output should be `5` (??? this example doesnt seem to make sense???)
```
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
11, 1, 1, 1
1, 11, 1, 1
1, 1, 11, 1
1, 1, 1, 11
```
